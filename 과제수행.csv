I see a lot of people defending BTS of, handsdown, really bad critisism. And many say that they cant get Pitch corrected (you'd probably call ist autotune, but thats the effect you hear on tracks Like Believe or all Tpain Songs, but Pitch correction is just correcting all the wrong tones, you really never hear it unless you are really deep in singing and stuff, it's basically in every music you nowadays hear) while on Stage."

BTS,2741,these are manufactured musical groups made by a record company in South Korea. They literally take young good looking Korean boys and they train them up to be pop stars. Even people who aren't even musicians. It's all about looks and marketing appeal. They are manipulating you. On top of that these guys are probably overworked and treated like pawns just to make money.

BTS,3838,"here i am. after months without kpop. i was starting to think it was just a phase. i stopped watching award shows, stopped reloading every ten seconds to see if jungkook posted a new selfie, and started listening to other music. but here i am, crying while listening to jimin singing i don't know why and feeling hella nostalgic. i can't even imagine what will happen when i listen to the truth untold. bts is like that ex that you can't get over. i was addicted to them, and i still am. they loved me and understood me. i idolized them while pretending to understand what they're going through, and even as i mature from the addicted and obsessed fangirl from 2016, i still don't have a right to empathize with them. ugh, i love them and it sucks sometimes. they were my lifeline. i remember crying by myself while listening to ttu. i remember being bullied for liking kpop. i remember my parents yelling at me anytime i would  ask for merch. but they music hits me so deep. just hearing the bighit jingle always gets me on the edge of my seat with a smile one my face. i won't lie and say they treatment i got from liking my boys was justified and well-deserved. music is evolving. THEY'RE evolving. i'm so proud of them. i just hope they realize that i love them so bad, and it's definitely not fake. kim namjoon, kim seokjin, min yoongi, jung hoseok, park jimin, kim taehyung, jeon jeongguk, BTS sdfghjkl- ????"

Health and they achieve their dreams .I can't describe my feelings and I know it's hard for many armys as well . what I'm sure of is that BTS deserve everything they dream of.

BTS,5006,"Not to be that person who writes an entire paragraph but like honestly I've never related to lyrics so badly in my entire life. I'm so emotional right now ajhshjwgsjjs

Last year, I fell in love with this boy who newly joined our college and what at first started to be a little crush expanded into something much more. He didn't care for me at all, in fact he treated me so badly i don't know at this point why i liked him so much but as time went on, the feeling of love i felt for him became to make me feel so painful. I became depressed, he started to become the only thing I cared about, I neglected everything for him even though he controlled every emotion of me and the only thing he did was make me sad and disappoint me. I really cared for him more than myself, I was failing school because I'd become so transfixed on becoming his ideal girl, I lost myself in the process, id become so different, i couldnt even recognise myself anymore and was becoming more and more distant from everyone else. I hated myself so much all the time, I always felt that I was never good enough for him and that he would never love me, all I saw were my weaknesses but i continously kept a strong image in front of him and lied through my teeth just so he would at least keep notice of me. I was so blind but I was convinced I was in love, I believed he was the only future I had, I didn't need anything or anyone else. Then one day, he started to treat me even more like trash and belittled my feelings and said some disgusting things then he blocked me. I'd never cried so much, my whole world that I'd built for myself was all for him, but it came crumbling down but as time went on I'd realised he had made me so ill both physically and mentally, whatever I felt for him, it can't have been love. I had fallen in love with the idea of him, it was all just an illusion, fake love. Now I can't even bear to crush on anyone ever again, I can't differentiate what true feelings are from fake feelings and just the thought of going through the that torture again makes me feel sick."

BTS,5370,"In 2018-beginning of 2019, i wanted to kill myself, erase myself from this world. I felt like i was nothing. I felt like no one loved me. I felt that everyone hated me because of the mistakes i made. But in June 2019, i was on Youtube watching gacha life videos (it's a game if you didn't know) some of the youtubers who made gacha videos (we call them Gachatubers) and they were actually k-pop fans and i went to check them out and i listen to BTS first ( i actually knew them before from watching their performance on America's Got talent)I listen to Idol and i loved it. I listen to more kpop groups and fell in love. Although, i was still depressed. I got made fun at by my friends ( i still am but i don't care anymore, some of my friends still make fun of me not my best friend Berlin tho). some of my classmates ask me questions that i didn't want to answer but some of my classmates were really supported of me. My parents make fun of me as a joke and i still take it offending because i'm dumb and they are just playing around with me and my own mother calls me jungkook for crying out, i'm like MOM! I have no idea why she calls me it. So yeah, i was still depressed for a few months, Then i realize something, i was getting loved, not just my family and best friend but by ARMY too. Y'all really saved me. from depression. from suicide, from being someone i didnt want to be. My friends are huge anime fans ( i dont have a problem with that) and they been trying to pull me from the kpop community and trying to get me into the anime community. I only watch one anime which i really loved called of course Ouran High School Host Club its pretty obvious . im not really into anime anymore tho. i still respect the people who watch it tho but i'm starting to get pretty bore at it.

BTS,5463,who else is blasting this in their ears right now lol
BTS,5464,"I am very confident,
this is just my theory

This song is the answer from alum LOVE YOURSELF, SAVE ME, so in this song, nothing can help BTS, but not to help those who help it, do your best but can't help. helping BTS is indeed ARMY, That's why BTS gave up but didn't give up, yes, even so, they are still grateful to have ARMY by their side, who helps them. Even though in the future ARMY will pursue their respective activities, namely getting married and raising children. BTS still doesn't want to, yes but whether they want it or not they have to let ARMY go. But even so, BTS still believes that ARMY remains by their side even though not as much as ARMY as they used to (now), and BTS believes that ARMY & BTS or BANGTAN actually love each other and don't forget us both. (that's true ARMY with BTS) it won't disappear. and BTS are willing even though their husband's ARMY is not them (namely BTS) but even if BTS and yes it's okay it's up to you :)"

BTS,5665,When I'm listening to this I'm feeling just fine ??
BTS,5666,"I’m so fine you so fine and we so fine seeing our boys happy,healthy and safe"
BTS,5667,Preciosa!! Como Jin ????
BTS,5668,Title is me when I dropped my m&m's all over the floor yesterday :(
BTS,5669,I came here from my own vid-
BTS,5670,Their voices ????
BTS,5671,"시리도록 푸른 하늘 아래 눈 떠
흠뻑 쏟아지는 햇살이 날 어지럽게 해
한껏 숨이 차오르고 심장은 뛰어
느껴져 너무 쉽게 나 살아있다는 걸"
BTS,5672,"this is bts' suggestion that the first song from them that you'll listen in 2020. my first song that i played from them is mic drop because it's like party party but in like listen liStEn, this is the song. for hope they said. and thank ? bts. A DECADE WITH YOU AND IT'S MY SECOND YEAR BEING WITH YOU. I LOVE YOU ALL. HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!??????"
BTS,5673,"I’m Fine upside down = Save Me

Beginning of I’m Fine was Save ME but altered a little bit"
BTS,5674,Btssss mis patrones
BTS,5675,"No one can be aware of what you're going through until you open up and share your feelings 

Our king taetae said that ???"
BTS,5676,"I SEE WHAT Y'ALL DID WITH  SAVE ME OML, I'm totally freaking out..."
BTS,5677,Todavia no supero que tiene que ver con save me =v
BTS,5678,"Y aqu? estoy, obedeciendole a mi YoonGi.! El dijo que para 2020 escucharamos est? canci?n,as? q aqu? estoy ????

Happy New Year Guys??♥?!!~"
BTS,5679,"I DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS SONG, I LOVE IT :)"
BTS,5680,Yoongi's rap be faster than my wifi????
BTS,5681,taehyung's beginning verse gets me everytime holy crap
BTS,5682,this feels so comforting yet chill yet also being hype
BTS,5683,"I'm sure a lot of you figured it out already, but in Fake Love it says on the wall,

Save Me"
BTS,5684,"In [Fake love] MV, taehyung's shot.If I turned to save me, it was I'm Fine.
Wasn't that the first part of the song spoiler?"
BTS,5685,"ESTO DEBER?A ESTAR EN UN MUSEO!!! ????????,ES SIMPLEMENTE HERMOSO,ARTE,VIDA ES TODO"
BTS,5686,Taehyung D?os vocal.
BTS,5687,It started with Save Me and the song is called I'm Fine and in Fake Love when it says Save Me if you flip it upside-down it says I'm Fine
BTS,5688,"now, learn corean lenguaje with the songs of my lovely singers uwu"
BTS,5689,this was made when idol came out
BTS,5690,NO CHINGUES EL INICIO ES A LO SAVE ME Y LEHODOSVEIE QUIERO LLORAR :'D SON TAN BELLOS Y PERFECTOS LOS 7 ??
BTS,5691,"Estoy muy impresionada , me sorprendio escuchar tan bella canci?n ???me lleg? al coraz?n al igual que las dem?s canciones????????"
BTS,5692,everyone stand for our new national anthem ???
BTS,5693,BRO THIS STILL SO FIIIIIIIIINE ♡♡♡♡♡
BTS,5694,You know what's funny? I definitely don't feel fine. Quite the opposite because I have an Algebra final tomorrow and I am so scared of failing.
BTS,5695,THE REASON WHY YOU HEAR SAVE ME IN THE BEGINNING IS BECAUSE IN PAST VIDEOS WHEN YOU SEE THE WORDS “SAVE ME” IN THE BACKGROUND AND FLIP IT OVER IT SAYS “IM FINE” AND VICE VERSA. ITS SUPPOSED TO SIGNIFY GROWING AWAY FROM A BAD PLACE AND TRULY LEARNING HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF
BTS,5696,"IN THE FAKE LOVE MV IT SAID IM FINE BUT IF YOU TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN IT SAID SAVE ME, AND THE BEGINNING OF THIS SONG SOUNDS LIKE SAVE ME. IM SCREAMMINGGG."
BTS,5697,this is such an amazing song
BTS,5698,la amo por siempre a esta canci?n <3
BTS,5699,"who else who didn't see the title at first thought this was Save Me?

...
no? just me..."
BTS,5700,I want someone who makes a remix of save me with it.
BTS,5701,IDK what happened to me I just wanted to listen to whole love yourself answer cuz I'm hella bored

BTS,5707,Yoongi's voice is a blessing

BTS,5709,"Why do you love bts ???
Me: here's why"
BTS,5710,"Kim Namjoon
Kim Seokjin
Min Yoongi
Jung Hoseok"
BTS,5711,"Of course, to the point where I thought this WAS “Save Me”. And maybe the name was always “I’m Fine”. But no!! It is even better!! It is the son of Love Maze + Save Me! When you think about it. It literally inherits the main employee of Save Me throughout the verses and maybe Love Maze ??"
BTS,5712,"I like how the intro in this is really similar to the one in Save Me, but the two songs have completely different meanings. It feels like Save Me is the beginning of the journey (I know someone already said that and yes I’m sorry :p) and this is the end, but it starts with the beginning of Save Me as a reflection or something."
BTS,5713,My favorite song on this album and together with save me and run definitely one of my favorite songs ever~
BTS,5714,"There is a fan made MV, thats where I got to know the song. This song just moves me."
BTS,5715,"Kim namjoon

BTS,5721,Me encanta ver comentarios en espa?ol!! :3 armys latinas!!
BTS,5722,Str3am Dynamite
BTS,5723,"Don't worry guys we're fine remember we love you,when in the group is gone, their songs will be with us??"
BTS,5724,LMFAOOO THAT ONE DISLIKE LOOKS SO DUMB NEXT TO ALL THOSE LIKES??

BTS,5738,When someone asks you if you’re fine and you answer with “Yes” when you’re actually BROKEN inside!!!??....but with BTS by your side you realize that no matter how hard it is everything will be fine and you’ll be happy again.
BTS,5739,I am living for the Drum 'N' Bass influences oh my god
BTS,5740,WELL DEMN Y IS PPL NOT TALKING ABOUT JIN’S HIGH NOTE LIKE GURLLLLL

BTS,5759,OK yoongi officially destroyed me this track
BTS,5760,TAE'S VOICE AT THE BEGINNING SOUNDS LIKE WATER DROPLETS. IT'S ETHEREAL.
BTS,5761,"No importa cuantas veces la escuche, me encanta ???"
BTS,5762,"al principio pense q era un remix d save me

BTS,5763,"Si im fine estoy bn , no pero te nesesito se que no tu ami no pero detente ,jusgame , defiendeme, solo espero el dia para estar bn  ... Sin ti es imposible por favor te prometo que te acompa?are porque estaremos bn..... Im fine

BTS,5766,"who is here after daechwita ahahah ????
daechwita is so fine fine fine ????"
BTS,5767,"It is already 2 years passed. However when I listen to this song again, I still remember the time when I facing a hard time. This song just come out at that time and I found it by chance. This song really comforts me a lot and help me to walk through the hard moment in my life. I am an ARMY at that time but not really into them deeply, but now everything change. I follow them as much as I can and I never feel disappointed towards them, not even a bit. I truly proud of them with their achievements and recognitions. Truly, they are the only most best superb excellent brilliant group in the entire world.  You can't ever denied that. It is a fact that we should acknowledge.  I encourage people who still questioning their success to look up all their song by understanding the lyrics and do some researches about the background  of BTS and their journey who comes from nobody, no one know about them at all, people ignore their talents, being cut off from broadcast to become a group who succeed worldwide, paved the way for others in breaking through western's  music's world and brought a small company from nearly bankrupt to one of the company that contribute to the economy of their country. Get rid all of the racisms and ignorance from your mind and try to accept them. I believe you will know why we, ARMY are so so so so so proud of them and proud to become an ARMY. Borahae.... 하트  하트....??????????????"
BTS,5768,i think its okay if u put subtitles :))
BTS,5769,The beginning music (whatever you call that) sounds like Save Me..........
BTS,5770,right to the feels
BTS,5771,Do all even hear how they are saying “fine” no one does that
BTS,5772,La rapline ?????? Ya saquen el cypher 5 >:'v
BTS,5773,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

BTS,5774,This song puts me to bed at night and wakes me up early morning ??
BTS,5775,"when this song dropped, i honestly thought i clicked on the wrong song"
BTS,5776,"You make me follow my dreams, you make me feel, you make me feel that i can be anything and anyone i want to be. You made me believe in myself and push myself beyond the limits of my surroundings and even my own world. You inspire me and motivate me. You made me free myself, Bangtan.. I wish i could just one day thank you for all your impact and effort to all ARMY worldwide. But i fear it won't be enough. But we, ARMY will always be there and support in the best biggest way we can."

Something i relearned recently, and i feel thats prominent throughout the ly series. When you dont love yourself and are afraid to be alone, you cling to people that arent healthy for you. This doesnt help you. Let go of their hand. Youll see that you really can survive without them. Just my thoughts tho.?? love yourself"

BTS,6275,"I’m Fine 노래 되게 좋은데, 나는 이 노래 들을 때마다 오묘한 감정이 자꾸 들고, 되게 슬프다고 해야하나? 멜로디가 날 울리는 그런게 약간 있는거 같아서 많이 들으면 내가 우울증 올 거 같아서 많이 듣지는 못했음. 노래는 진짜 캡짱임. 그냥 들으면 너무 슬프고 오묘한 기분이라 머리가 복잡해진달까. 오해는 하지 말아주셨음 해요. 저도 방탄을 사랑하는 평범한 아미니까.. , 저 이상하게 보지 마시고.. 진짜 노래 완전 좋거든요. 유독 저만 그런거니까, 욕은 하지 말아주세요."

BTS,7304,"this song is so emotional for me, its one of my favourites"
BTS,7305,KIM TAEHYUNG
BTS,7306,"I can't help but cry every time I listen to this song now. All those children that died in the ferry could've been saved if they escaped. Japan and American boats were near there and wanted to help them but Korea refused. Such a big tragedy 300+ students and teachers died. Many students filmed their last moments and it was posted on the internet, they badly wanted to survive. I was crying so hard watching those kids that didn't know they were going to die laughing as if there was nothing for 30 minutes when the boat was really tilted. The captain of the boat told the kids to stay where they where so everyone that stayed died and everyone that left survived. When it tilted a little more, the kids starting filming their last moment messages to their family saying Who's going to be with my sister if I die If I live, I don't want my child ever going on field trips Mom! Dad! I Love you Captain, I hate you because you made me die before I can do anything in life Sister, even though we fought a lot, I still love you.  The NASTY captain and other crew members actually ran away while it was sinking. The rescuers only saved the people that were outside of the boat, the other kids suffered and drowned, there were no windows or doors to get out from and there weren't enough life jackets for everyone. How much pain must the kids have gone through? They didn't just die but suffocated and tried to get out when there was no way out. THATS MURDER. What about the kids who got out alive and all their friends died, how guilty they must have been? The people that they see every day, eat with every day, hang out with every day were murdered when they only escaped. I'd be devastated. I hope the people that survived are living a good life."
BTS,7307,"Idk but whenever I hear this ,my eyes will become an ocean in just a sec????????????????, this song is really healing, this is a masterpiece ??????????"
BTS,7308,This song will never get old
BTS,7309,AMO MUITO! ♡
BTS,7310,Lets see how many people are watching this in quarantine?
BTS,7311,"For anyone who didn't know the theory about Spring Day i will kindly explain to you here. I'm sure some of you have heard about the Sewol Ferry tragedy. Short info, the sinking of sewol ferry was an absolutely heart-breaking tragedy that resulted in a year long media blackout in order to cover the incident up. The ferry was a transport that went from Incheon to Jeju island, that at that time (April 2014) was carrying over 400 people. At some point it sank, resulting in the deaths over 300 people where most of the victims were high school students who were on a field trip at that time. Moving on, if you watch the first scene on Spring Day you can see Taehyung leaning his head on to the train track. There, he was feeling the survivor's guilt. The guilt of having survived while his friends have passed away. And then there was Jungkook looking outside the window. He is also a survivor, thinking about his lost friends. Next we have Jimin, he even goes back to the sea to reminisce. Next scene we have Namjoon rapping inside the train. Do you all notice the abandoned suitcases and clothes in that scene? Those abandoned stuff represent the students who went on the field trip with their belongings and never came back. It's widely known that the Korean Government has been heavily criticized by the way they handled the tragedy. In namjoon's lyrics he mentioned Snowpiercer Snowpiercer is a movie that symbolizes human society, where the people in front of the train (upper class & government) treats the tail of the train (regular people) in an inhumane way. And then Namjoon opened the door and we can see a big OMELAS sign. As Umu said, Omelas is a name of a fictional town in a book called The one who walk away from omelas The book explains about how someone's happiness means someone else's suffering. then we have Jin's scene. He represents the ones who have passed away. He looks up at all the other who are climbing and growing up while he is stuck at the bottom, unable to grow up. The rusty merry-go-around behind Jungkook represents a loss of childhood. And then skip to the part where Jimin symbolically picks up a pair of shoes of the survivor washed up on a shore. And then we have Yoongi sitting on a mountain pile of clothes. Those clothes represents all the victims. Skip to where Jungkook is standing still while the others are running behind him. As you can see there were yellow ribbons tied on the merry-go-around. Those ribbons are similar to the Sewol Ferry Yellow Ribbon Campaign and the next scene is where jungkook finally wakes up and run to seek justice for what happened. and then he thought he was fighting alone but then all the members showed up next to him. And then the train passed by, this scene symbolize that what's done is done. The dead won't come back to life. And then did you see the clothes outside the train? The clothes symbolizes how the dead is outside of the world (the world being the train) next there was a scene where all 7 of them sat on the mountain pile of clothes above the clouds (heaven) this scene symbolizes that all of the victims are in a better place. Last scene were they got off the train you can see a big tree. The tree represents hope, a new life, a spring day not a cold and dark winter day. And then Jimin hang a pair of shoes on the tree. In many cultures, shoes are hang on trees to commemorate the dead."
BTS,7312,Fun fact: Suga and RM wrote this song at a park.

BTS,7387,"This song never leaves charts which is what BTS probably aimed for tbh. 
For those of you who don't know, Spring Day was made to commemorate the innocent lives lost on the Sewol Ferry and to criticize the government for not getting the survivors the justice they deserve. 
If Spring Day stays on the charts, that makes it 100x harder for anyone to forget the disaster that took place and serves as a reminder of how messed up society is. "
BTS,7388,"SUGA ????
he works so hard and is professional
The day he rests, let's go forward and break more records for PRODUCER MIN SUGA

BTS,7391,"First heard this in Tiny Desk. Not an army but I noticed that in original version, the first part is RM but in their live performances it’s J-Hope."
BTS,7392,"Everyone talks about this song is meant for people who have lost a friend or family or loved one... but this song is special to me because for a long while, I lost myself. I lost who I was. I lost my passions, things I enjoyed doing, motivation, etc... I struggled for years to find myself again. This song is just that reminder to me that even though I feel like I'm slipping again... I'm not. Feelings change, like seasons. Sometimes they're harder to deal with. Sometimes it's harder to pull myself back... but that all changes over time - if I give it time."

If you can stream BTS and other groups from low  labels so that the hierarchy will crumble... Seeing the power of A.R.M.Y. I am sure that we can do it."

It's 2:20am rn、 I just heard this song a while ago and I thought it's just about a love story, a sad song but as soon as I've watch this MV, I knew that it's something else so I checked the comments and It game me chills because I have known the incident years ago and it breaks my heart whenever I remember how it happened. This song is just so beautiful and painful at the same time. The pain and sadness are well expressed in this song that even if I just heard it for the first time, I already felt it."

Me: Simply because my Bangtan isn't  focused much on making BOPS. They are telling stories through their music, a music for healing, as what Bighit says. We find comfort in the arms of their songs, in Bangtan. So next time you'll ask me again, you should keep this in mind. It's not all about the bop, it's about giving comfort and message of love through your songs. No matter how headbanger they make, if it doesn't send a connection from the singer to the listener, it won't make sense."

I cried. I prayed that he realizes to come back to us. And now we are living together with the kids, though he is not a kPop fan and annoys me everytime saying some sad words about BTS, he actually downloading wallpapers on my tablet and changed it every other day.

BTS,7911,"7 years together
6 members and one leader
5 different places where they were born 
4 vocalists"
BTS,7912,Only jason derulo fans disliked this. Cause they dont have the brain capacity to understand what this song represents
BTS,7913,"Seriously it hurts how no one talks about jhope not getting any line and still his backing vocals carried this song
Like his voice is the reason we get the chilling effect when we listen this song"
BTS,7914,"the fact that the first words of this song are Miss you
 while the last words are
Please stay,please stay there a little longer"
BTS,7915,"me: Checks spring days likes and dislikes

(edit: omfg! I never got this much likes! thank you so much! I purple you army!)"
BTS,7928,"Summary of 'Spring Day' BTS: 

What makes the MV for “Spring Day” so touching is that it’s not all hopeful. There’s sadness, reluctance, and longing as the members begin to move forward, away from the familiar and on to something new. “Spring Day” is all about loss, about missing someone, about clinging to youth. But most importantly, it’s about carrying on. The memories of the past will always be there, and we can chase them forever and end up in a hopeless cycle ? like the washing machine featured ? if we so choose. Or, we can mourn in our own way, move on, and truly live. "
BTS,7929,This song is soo great and the meaning behind this song is soo deep that honestly made me cry after watching it. BTS are making history every new song they release and this song is going down  as a legendary song wow beautiful song just beautiful ??????

At first, I didn't really understand the music video but after learning about the Sewol tragedy, you could see so much symbolism put into this song regarding it. I'm just gonna mention a few that I first picked up.
After the incident, the survivors mentioned that everything feels empty and they're all alone without their friends, hence why the members are seen by themselves in this MV. "

BTS,8235,"For anyone who didn't know the theory about Spring Day i will kindly explain to you here. I'm sure some of you have heard about the Sewol Ferry tragedy. Short info, the sinking of sewol ferry was an absolutely heart-breaking tragedy that resulted in a year long media blackout in order to cover the incident up. The ferry was a transport that went from Incheon to Jeju island, that at that time (April 2014) was carrying over 400 people. At some point it sank, resulting in the deaths over 300 people where most of the victims were high school students who were on a field trip at that time. Moving on, if you watch the first scene on Spring Day you can see Taehyung leaning his head on to the train track. There, he was feeling the survivor's guilt. The guilt of having survived while his friends have passed away. And then there was Jungkook looking outside the window. He is also a survivor, thinking about his lost friends. Next we have Jimin, he even goes back to the sea to reminisce. Next scene we have Namjoon rapping inside the train. Do you all notice the abandoned suitcases and clothes in that scene? Those abandoned stuff represent the students who went on the field trip with their belongings and never came back. It's widely known that the Korean Government has been heavily criticized by the way they handled the tragedy. In namjoon's lyrics he mentioned Snowpiercer Snowpiercer is a movie that symbolizes human society, where the people in front of the train (upper class & government) treats the tail of the train (regular people) in an inhumane way. And then Namjoon opened the door and we can see a big OMELAS sign. As Umu said, Omelas is a name of a fictional town in a book called The one who walk away from omelas The book explains about how someone's happiness means someone else's suffering. then we have Jin's scene. He represents the ones who have passed away. He looks up at all the other who are climbing and growing up while he is stuck at the bottom, unable to grow up. The rusty merry-go-around behind Jungkook represents a loss of childhood. And then skip to the part where Jimin symbolically picks up a pair of shoes of the survivor washed up on a shore. And then we have Yoongi sitting on a mountain pile of clothes. Those clothes represents all the victims. Skip to where Jungkook is standing still while the others are running behind him. As you can see there were yellow ribbons tied on the merry-go-around. Those ribbons are similar to the Sewol Ferry Yellow Ribbon Campaign and the next scene is where jungkook finally wakes up and run to seek justice for what happened. and then he thought he was fighting alone but then all the members showed up next to him. And then the train passed by, this scene symbolize that what's done is done. The dead won't come back to life. And then did you see the clothes outside the train? The clothes symbolizes how the dead is outside of the world (the world being the train) next there was a scene where all 7 of them sat on the mountain pile of clothes above the clouds (heaven) this scene symbolizes that all of the victims are in a better place. Last scene were they got off the train you can see a big tree. The tree represents hope, a new life, a spring day not a cold and dark winter day. And then Jimin hang a pair of shoes on the tree. In many cultures, shoes are hang on trees to commemorate the dead"
BTS,8236,Music so beautiful
BTS,8237,"No one will probably read this but... story time. I used to hate k-pop in general. I only became a fan last year from fire. I really really hated them before but look at me now. I'm 101% BTS Trash.

BTS,8684,Anyone still obsessed with this song and mv?
BTS,8685,I was screaming when I first saw this mv.... And I'm still screaming ??
BTS,8686,"I just realized that You Never Walk Alone's (YNWA) pre-promotion was a bit late. There was no tracklist, teaser or concept photos when the pre-ordering started. We literally blindly bought the album. No one knows if it's a repackage or not. So we aimed for at least 800k-1M sales. The album shop sites crashed. And then YNWA's tracklist was released. Some were disappointed because it's a repackage and only has 4 new songs. So our sales goal was decreased to at least 400k-500k sales. Compared to WINGS, WINGS was promoted well and is a full album. BUT 700K PRE-ORDER SALES FOR YNWA??? I AM STILL SHOOK. I never thought it could surpass WINGS pre-order sales. BTS is a legend ya'll! Congratulations to BTS and Bighit. And congratulations to all ARMYs! We've exceeded our goal. I'm so proud :')"

BTS,9270,to be honest I know a few people have been wanting BTS to do an English song but I hope they never do. Korean is such a beautiful language and there's just so much meaning behind their lyrics that I believe the feelings can't really be translated into English. Stay true to who you are BTS and never be pressured to do anything you're not comfortable with.

I got curious one day and decided to search it up. Let me say one thing, my reaction was priceless. It was like I found my corner of the internet. I memorized all their names in relation to their pictures, and at first it was hard (I couldn't recognize anyone), but now I can recite all their names in relation to their pictures at sight. Ah, how pleasing it is. BTS is a new kind of lifestyle for me. A place where I can listen and be free. You all have transformed me, and I hope to transform others one day. "

Think about it, if we organize ourselves well and even set an alarm as a reminder of the voting time, then we can do wonders for our boys. OR EVEN BETTER, we can have both mass streaming and mass voting at the same time. It will save us alot if we can do that. If each of us has at least 10 different accounts to vote we will surely have more than enough votes. BTS has come from far and they have been working hard every step of the way. It is now our turn to work hard for them. They deserve all those nominations they got and even more. LET US NOT SLEEP ON OUR BOYS. So what do you guys think? Is it a good idea or what! "

BTS son tan conocidos por todo el mundo que sus canciones son super conocidas y ellos se est?n ganando el coraz?n de muchas personas gracias a su esfuerzo lo est?n logrando"
BTS,9670,Who is here after Jimin dyed his hair as like as BS&T era hair in SY&LY final concert?  Grey is his colour for sure ????
BTS,9671,"How many international army're here

1like = 1 international army"
BTS,9672,"The story behind this MV and the WINGS short story’s are soooo complex and but it all makes fucking sense. If you see the storyline behind it, I swear the whole MV will be different for you. I’m so shocked. Still shocked omg. WATCH THE STORYLINE BEHIND THE WINGS ALBUM AND THE SHORT MOVIES. It’s a framing masterpiece and so creative I can’t"
BTS,9673,"This will forever and always be the hottest, most elaborate, most beautifully made video in all of human existence"
BTS,9674,"suddenly I heard one of the part said Money, Money, Money 
??? Money and this song have no relationship! and When I saw the Subtitle, Many, Many, Many XD"
BTS,9675,This is probably the most aesthetic music video I've ever watched

BTS,9683,"Everybody is talking about how great the mv was... and then there’s me 

Me: “JIN KISSED THE STATUE!”"
BTS,9684,When its boy with love era but you can't simply forget this masterpiece!
BTS,9685,I hope someone will organise a YT stræming party for Dynamite for a whole week (7 days) in hopes to reach 1B before the release of the BE album so that we can focus more on the new release and have enough time to recharge and practice before the drop. If I'm not mistaken Dynamite only needs approximately 440M to reach the goal. If we can at least have 70M per day we can reach the #DynamiteTo1B and be one of the fastest MV to reach that milestone (current holder is Adele's Hello with 87 days if I'm not mistaken). And maybe we can dedicate it for Yoongi and wishing him a speedy recovery while showing him that ARMY got his back and we will be more determined as ever. 
BTS,9686,Siempre supe que BTS sacaba arte pero BS&T me dej? impactada.
BTS,9687,Si se dan cuenta dice “lupita m? amor 
BTS,9688,Billboard probably regrets not letting them perform.
BTS,9689,This song never gets old:')

But the captions on and its SO different"
BTS,9703,"Just think how much power this entire album holds. Imagine BTS being this big today. I don't say that their music is not good today but this hits different. I mean imagine this dropping today. The fit, the hair, the atmosphere. Everything is so well done. And no one cad disagree ???"
BTS,9704,"Hey ARMY, it would be really cool if we can make 8 BTS songs reached 1B before their 8th year anniversary. An ARMY even says that they could be the first artist to have the record of 8 MVs with 1B v13ws if it happens and that would be a great gift for their 8th year anniversary. We can make it happen"
BTS,9705,"OMG!!! I just saw that there was a german sentence over the mirror.
That´s so cool, because I´m from Germany and I can translate it!
It means... You still have to have chaos in yourself to bear a dancing star!
...sorry if my english isn´t that great, but I´m still learning it at school."
BTS,9706,I still need the name of the book ?? namjoon help a sister out and give me the title ??

BTS,9767,"SO BASICALLY, 
The whole thing is based on Demian by Hermann Hesse-
It's also a story of youth and a boy finding his way through the world and losing his innocence and trying to find the contrast between all things good and evil, which has been BTS' theme. (adolescence)"

BTS,9852,"Why do people say their music is trash? This isn't trash. I got recommended Fake Love and it's amazing too. I'm gonna check as many of their songs out to see for myself but so far, I don't see trash.

UPDATE: Their discography is so VAST! I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with how much I have to cover haha. I think my favorite so far is Black Swan. It's so beautiful, and I saw that it had a more classical version too, the dancing, the lyrics, everything took my breath away. How are they this masterful lyrically, artistically and so adept at tackling real life, relatable issues in such mind-boggling manner? I'm trying to find words to describe what I'm feeling right now and it's hard. These guys are an enigma and I think at this point there's no going back for me. I have to know them more, I have to find out exactly who they are. I'm so excited!"

EVERYTIME I THINK I AM TIRED I THINK OF HOW THEY WERE TIRED BUT GAVE US ALL OF THOSE THINGS... SO PLZ DONT GIVE UP IF U TAKE A BREAK TAKE A SHORT ONE BECAUSE BTS TOOK ONE. ME VOTING LIKE AN IDIOT IS MY WAY OF REPAYING BTS FOR NOT TAKING A BREAK. FOR NOT GIVING UP. THEY DESERVE WINS JUST AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER GROUP."
BTS,9934,"No kpop group can pull of this concept like BTS does...like really it's been more than 2 years and still no other kpop has managed to make such a bop and get themselves big...
Edit : what I'm saying is no group has managed to blow up the way BTS did that's why they're called a phenomenon and don't come here mentioning other groups just because you're salty I didn't mention other groups nor did I say they're less talented..I have no reason to say that since I do like other groups too..but what BTS has achieved being from a small company...you can't compare to any group."
BTS,9935,"Army, we all heard about Suga ????
So, let's break more records
keep on streaming- Black Swan, Mic Drop, Idol, Blood sweat and tears, Fake Love, Dynamite

BTS,9937,"I still feel like this whole wings dark concept is still above all of us, honestly this music video is just beyond me. It’s still a mystery what exactly happened and there are so many connections, theories and symbolism. And not to mention the amazing cinematography, music and just the production and aesthetic was profoundly unique and out if this world. We should all be lucky to have even witnessed such art honestly. I will NEVER comprehend the immense greatness of this perfect masterpiece. Thank you. ?? and happy new year"

BTS,9966,0:56 quien es la pinche Lupita>:v
BTS,9967,"Gosh,Mr.Park Jimin I can't stop looking at you."
BTS,9968,"No one talks about the hell and heaven passage. With Jin standing and looking at the painting at 0:41 . One has white column while the other is black column, which I think is way to hell. The room with Jimin and Suga, is like Adam and Eve to me. Jimin holds the apple which Adam and Eve commits a sin and Suga represents that the first Woman and Man being exposed to sin because his holding a blindfold. (well, correct me if I am wrong). On the same room, V jumped outside the white column, which is where heaven is. V is the fallen angel who tempted Adam and Eve. Then, I saw Suga blindfolding Jimin, Again, I am not sure with this, Suga blinded Jimin with the truth about righteousness. So, when he removed his blindfold in the end his tears are green which, for me, represents the pain mankind is experiencing now with the sin they committed. Next, lets switch back to V and Jin's case. Jin was the mankind judas. There was a scene when they are having a suffer. And first thing that comes in my mind is the last suffer. Apples on each plates represents temptation, like in Adam and Eve. He then put up this cup for a toast and look behind him, like someone is calling him, well, that must be lucifer. Jin, who is tempted with the fallen angel(lucifer), V. V blinded him. With V kneeling with white curtain represents he is really from heaven. Those scars are his wings. Then, Jin kissed the statue with V's black wings which is like sealing a deal with a devil. Then the creepy thing happened, V's smirk of victory. He got Jin. He got mankind.  Then Jin looked at the mirror which only reflects his image with black background. He is in hell now but looking on the flowers on the table it represents hope to change. But in the end, he broke himself and gave in to the devil. That's all. Thank you."
BTS,9969,"HOLY SHIT, MY GOD I AM IN HEAVEN I JUST SEE ANGELS. AESTHETIC, ART, BEAUTY, SUBLIMITY, THIS IS PERFECTION."
BTS,9970,is there even someone streaming bst with me?!
BTS,9971,"The fact that they even discussed disbanding early this year hit me hard. So I'm back here right now and every moment I can every day until the time comes that I can't be able to anymore (means I'm dead).

Edit: I mean, the only day that I can't be able to support Bangtan anymore is when I'm dead."

BTS,9993,What I've noticed about their songs is that even when the rapping starts abruptly it doesn't disturbs the coarse of the tune. It's abrupt but still smooth and people like me who doesn't like rap so much still find it enjoying and sometimes find it the best part of the whole song??
