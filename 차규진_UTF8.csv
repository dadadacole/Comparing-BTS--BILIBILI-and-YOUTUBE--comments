THEY'RE evolving. i'm so proud of them. i just hope they realize that i love them so bad, and it's definitely not fake. kim namjoon, kim seokjin, min yoongi, jung hoseok, park jimin, kim taehyung, jeon jeongguk, BTS sdfghjkl- ????",,,,,

Last year, I fell in love with this boy who newly joined our college and what at first started to be a little crush expanded into something much more. He didn't care for me at all, in fact he treated me so badly i don't know at this point why i liked him so much but as time went on, the feeling of love i felt for him became to make me feel so painful. I became depressed, he started to become the only thing I cared about, I neglected everything for him even though he controlled every emotion of me and the only thing he did was make me sad and disappoint me. I really cared for him more than myself, I was failing school because I'd become so transfixed on becoming his ideal girl, I lost myself in the process, id become so different, i couldnt even recognise myself anymore and was becoming more and more distant from everyone else. I hated myself so much all the time, I always felt that I was never good enough for him and that he would never love me, all I saw were my weaknesses but i continously kept a strong image in front of him and lied through my teeth just so he would at least keep notice of me. I was so blind but I was convinced I was in love, I believed he was the only future I had, I didn't need anything or anyone else. Then one day, he started to treat me even more like trash and belittled my feelings and said some disgusting things then he blocked me. I'd never cried so much, my whole world that I'd built for myself was all for him, but it came crumbling down but as time went on I'd realised he had made me so ill both physically and mentally, whatever I felt for him, it can't have been love. I had fallen in love with the idea of him, it was all just an illusion, fake love. Now I can't even bear to crush on anyone ever again, I can't differentiate what true feelings are from fake feelings and just the thought of going through the that torture again makes me feel sick.",,,,,

BTS,5370,"In 2018-beginning of 2019, i wanted to kill myself, erase myself from this world. I felt like i was nothing. I felt like no one loved me. I felt that everyone hated me because of the mistakes i made. But in June 2019, i was on Youtube watching gacha life videos (it's a game if you didn't know) some of the youtubers who made gacha videos (we call them Gachatubers) and they were actually k-pop fans and i went to check them out and i listen to BTS first ( i actually knew them before from watching their performance on America's Got talent)I listen to Idol and i loved it. I listen to more kpop groups and fell in love. Although, i was still depressed. I got made fun at by my friends ( i still am but i don't care anymore, some of my friends still make fun of me not my best friend Berlin tho). some of my classmates ask me questions that i didn't want to answer but some of my classmates were really supported of me. My parents make fun of me as a joke and i still take it offending because i'm dumb and they are just playing around with me and my own mother calls me jungkook for crying out, i'm like MOM! I have no idea why she calls me it. So yeah, i was still depressed for a few months, Then i realize something, i was getting loved, not just my family and best friend but by ARMY too. Y'all really saved me. from depression. from suicide, from being someone i didnt want to be. My friends are huge anime fans ( i dont have a problem with that) and they been trying to pull me from the kpop community and trying to get me into the anime community. I only watch one anime which i really loved called of course Ouran High School Host Club its pretty obvious . im not really into anime anymore tho. i still respect the people who watch it tho but i'm starting to get pretty bore at it.

this is just my theory

This song is the answer from alum LOVE YOURSELF, SAVE ME, so in this song, nothing can help BTS, but not to help those who help it, do your best but can't help. helping BTS is indeed ARMY, That's why BTS gave up but didn't give up, yes, even so, they are still grateful to have ARMY by their side, who helps them. Even though in the future ARMY will pursue their respective activities, namely getting married and raising children. BTS still doesn't want to, yes but whether they want it or not they have to let ARMY go. But even so, BTS still believes that ARMY remains by their side even though not as much as ARMY as they used to (now), and BTS believes that ARMY & BTS or BANGTAN actually love each other and don't forget us both. (that's true ARMY with BTS) it won't disappear. and BTS are willing even though their husband's ARMY is not them (namely BTS) but even if BTS and yes it's okay it's up to you :)",,,,,

BTS,5767,"It is already 2 years passed. However when I listen to this song again, I still remember the time when I facing a hard time. This song just come out at that time and I found it by chance. This song really comforts me a lot and help me to walk through the hard moment in my life. I am an ARMY at that time but not really into them deeply, but now everything change. I follow them as much as I can and I never feel disappointed towards them, not even a bit. I truly proud of them with their achievements and recognitions. Truly, they are the only most best superb excellent brilliant group in the entire world.  You can't ever denied that. It is a fact that we should acknowledge.  I encourage people who still questioning their success to look up all their song by understanding the lyrics and do some researches about the background  of BTS and their journey who comes from nobody, no one know about them at all, people ignore their talents, being cut off from broadcast to become a group who succeed worldwide, paved the way for others in breaking through western's  music's world and brought a small company from nearly bankrupt to one of the company that contribute to the economy of their country. Get rid all of the racisms and ignorance from your mind and try to accept them. I believe you will know why we, ARMY are so so so so so proud of them and proud to become an ARMY.

Edit: BTS IS COMING BACK ON 20TH NOVEMBER WITH A FULL SELF PRODUCED ALBUM BE.Why are we calling it full self produced album?,Didn't the members produced/helped produce their previous albums too? Yes they did but this time there is no such sector where the member's didn't participate.Starting from producing the songs,deciding the concept,visual presentation of the members to even album covers",,,,,

BTS,7306,"I can't help but cry every time I listen to this song now. All those children that died in the ferry could've been saved if they escaped. Japan and American boats were near there and wanted to help them but Korea refused. Such a big tragedy 300+ students and teachers died. Many students filmed their last moments and it was posted on the internet, they badly wanted to survive. I was crying so hard watching those kids that didn't know they were going to die laughing as if there was nothing for 30 minutes when the boat was really tilted. The captain of the boat told the kids to stay where they where so everyone that stayed died and everyone that left survived. When it tilted a little more, the kids starting filming their last moment messages to their family saying Who's going to be with my sister if I die If I live, I don't want my child ever going on field trips Mom! Dad! I Love you Captain, I hate you because you made me die before I can do anything in life Sister, even though we fought a lot, I still love you.  The NASTY captain and other crew members actually ran away while it was sinking. The rescuers only saved the people that were outside of the boat, the other kids suffered and drowned, there were no windows or doors to get out from and there weren't enough life jackets for everyone. How much pain must the kids have gone through? They didn't just die but suffocated and tried to get out when there was no way out. THATS MURDER. What about the kids who got out alive and all their friends died, how guilty they must have been? The people that they see every day, eat with every day, hang out with every day were murdered when they only escaped. I'd be devastated. I hope the people that survived are living a good life.",,,,,
BTS,7307,"Idk but whenever I hear this ,my eyes will become an ocean in just a sec????????????????, this song is really healing, this is a masterpiece ??????????",,,,,
BTS,7308,This song will never get old,,,,,
BTS,7309,AMO MUITO! ??,,,,,
BTS,7310,Lets see how many people are watching this in quarantine?,,,,,
BTS,7311,"For anyone who didn't know the theory about Spring Day i will kindly explain to you here. I'm sure some of you have heard about the Sewol Ferry tragedy. Short info, the sinking of sewol ferry was an absolutely heart-breaking tragedy that resulted in a year long media blackout in order to cover the incident up. The ferry was a transport that went from Incheon to Jeju island, that at that time (April 2014) was carrying over 400 people. At some point it sank, resulting in the deaths over 300 people where most of the victims were high school students who were on a field trip at that time. Moving on, if you watch the first scene on Spring Day you can see Taehyung leaning his head on to the train track. There, he was feeling the survivor's guilt. The guilt of having survived while his friends have passed away. And then there was Jungkook looking outside the window. He is also a survivor, thinking about his lost friends. Next we have Jimin, he even goes back to the sea to reminisce. Next scene we have Namjoon rapping inside the train. Do you all notice the abandoned suitcases and clothes in that scene? Those abandoned stuff represent the students who went on the field trip with their belongings and never came back. It's widely known that the Korean Government has been heavily criticized by the way they handled the tragedy. In namjoon's lyrics he mentioned Snowpiercer Snowpiercer is a movie that symbolizes human society, where the people in front of the train (upper class & government) treats the tail of the train (regular people) in an inhumane way. And then Namjoon opened the door and we can see a big OMELAS sign. As Umu said, Omelas is a name of a fictional town in a book called The one who walk away from omelas The book explains about how someone's happiness means someone else's suffering. then we have Jin's scene. He represents the ones who have passed away. He looks up at all the other who are climbing and growing up while he is stuck at the bottom, unable to grow up. The rusty merry-go-around behind Jungkook represents a loss of childhood. And then skip to the part where Jimin symbolically picks up a pair of shoes of the survivor washed up on a shore. And then we have Yoongi sitting on a mountain pile of clothes. Those clothes represents all the victims. Skip to where Jungkook is standing still while the others are running behind him. As you can see there were yellow ribbons tied on the merry-go-around. Those ribbons are similar to the Sewol Ferry Yellow Ribbon Campaign and the next scene is where jungkook finally wakes up and run to seek justice for what happened. and then he thought he was fighting alone but then all the members showed up next to him. And then the train passed by, this scene symbolize that what's done is done. The dead won't come back to life. And then did you see the clothes outside the train? The clothes symbolizes how the dead is outside of the world (the world being the train) next there was a scene where all 7 of them sat on the mountain pile of clothes above the clouds (heaven) this scene symbolizes that all of the victims are in a better place. Last scene were they got off the train you can see a big tree. The tree represents hope, a new life, a spring day not a cold and dark winter day. And then Jimin hang a pair of shoes on the tree. In many cultures, shoes are hang on trees to commemorate the dead.",,,,,

BTS,7387,"This song never leaves charts which is what BTS probably aimed for tbh. 
For those of you who don't know, Spring Day was made to commemorate the innocent lives lost on the Sewol Ferry and to criticize the government for not getting the survivors the justice they deserve. 
If Spring Day stays on the charts, that makes it 100x harder for anyone to forget the disaster that took place and serves as a reminder of how messed up society is. ",,,,,

Me: Simply because my Bangtan isn't  focused much on making BOPS. They are telling stories through their music, a music for healing, as what Bighit says. We find comfort in the arms of their songs, in Bangtan. So next time you'll ask me again, you should keep this in mind. It's not all about the bop, it's about giving comfort and message of love through your songs.

And now we are living together with the kids, though he is not a kPop fan and annoys me everytime saying some sad words about BTS, he actually downloading wallpapers on my tablet and changed it every other day.

What makes the MV for ?úSpring Day??so touching is that it?ôs not all hopeful. There?ôs sadness, reluctance, and longing as the members begin to move forward, away from the familiar and on to something new. ?úSpring Day??is all about loss, about missing someone, about clinging to youth. But most importantly, it?ôs about carrying on. The memories of the past will always be there, and we can chase them forever and end up in a hopeless cycle ? like the washing machine featured ? if we so choose. Or, we can mourn in our own way, move on, and truly live. ",,,,,

I live in India, and I love playing piano but i like playing western classical pieces but all my family members doesn't like it and whenever I play a piece they start saying things like I am wasting my time or something like that. So one time, my older cousin bro started saying things like, what are u even playing, just tan tan karti rahti hai,   u r just coping the song. After hearing these things for years , I was getting annoyed. Then like we argued a little then   he just started saying things like I play same piece( well it's true cause I got lazy and didn't learnt any new piece), and told his mom (which was also there to visit us) that I listen to singers whose language I don't even understand, and then I was getting more annoyed so I just started playing on my phone cause I don't wanna argue more. Then he tried to talk with me but I was ignoring him cause I was mad at him. Then he says if I didn't talk to him then he is gonna ignore me and I said ok ( I was really mad ok maybe   it is my mistake to say ok) And now he is ignoring me. My mom and dad was mad at me cause I got mad at him, and told me I have no manners, and that he was just joking and he can joke like that cause he is older then me. But it still hurt when u joke about something that I love doing. To be honest, I am sensitive type of person so I get annoyed easily , that's why they thought I was overreacting, that's they were mad at me. Am I wrong? Can you help me army by replying plz?

But at this time we are breaking a new record and answering one billion view**ers in a month... Maybe this number is very big but I will make the topic simpler for you... If we make 100 million view**ers, the first day we'll be out of 900 million. If we divide it by 29 days, we have to make 31 million view**ers every day. This thing is not difficult because if every Army saw the section twice a day we will reach this number But the thing that we need to do now is to spread this thing everywhere... And who can translate into other languages should do this and spread to all the Armys.

BTS,10018,"When I listened to the song the first time I cried. I entered a stage of depression and even started cutting.... once. I tried to be strong and remember that I have people who care... but it was hard. 1 month later I was considering listening to a BTS song, I had always dismissed it as weird and dumb. So I watched DNA and my world exploded. My friend that same day told me about BTS being extra af in America. I was hooked, I barely slept because I wanted to know everything, (that may sound bad but before this I was crying myself every night and I was very suicidal) I could tell them apart in less then a day. I met a incredible friend on discord who was a BTS stan and knew everything, till this day she is still patient enough to answer all of my questions. Then I realized something, my home life was improving, I wasn't procrastinating on my school work as much and for the first time in a long time I was caught up. I laughed at everything they did I cried at them being 100% real with ARMY and showing how much they truly cared. I felt loved. I felt happy. I felt alive. This group of 7 crackheaded boys, has single handily got rid of my depression improved my life at home and at school. Thank you thank you thank you thank you.  You have truly changed my life. This song is beautiful and pure and a god send. I listen to it whenever I feel down. ",,,,,

Being an army feels like having a huge family, we're bounded by this music. Epiphany is so special. It's like personal closure for the times when I didn't want to face the world and was wounded in a small place. I'm just so glad to be here, living and witnessing the good BTS does to people around the world, it's amazing",,,,,
